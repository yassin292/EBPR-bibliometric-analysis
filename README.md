# EBPR Bibliometric Analysis
This repository contains the data, scripts, and figures used to perform a bibliometric analysis of research on **Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal (EBPR)** from **2000 to 2026**.

The analysis explores the evolution of EBPR research using bibliometric methods implemented in **R** with the **bibliometrix** package.

---

## Objectives

The aim of this analysis is to:

- Identify trends in EBPR scientific production.
- Explore the main research themes in the field.
- Detect emerging topics and thematic evolution.
- Analyze international collaboration networks.

---

## Data Source

The dataset was obtained from **Scopus** using a query related to EBPR and wastewater phosphorus removal.

The exported file was processed using the `bibliometrix` R package.

Because of database licensing restrictions, the raw bibliographic dataset may not be redistributed publicly.

## Methods

The bibliometric analysis was conducted in **R** using the following packages:

- bibliometrix
- tidyverse
- ggplot2
- igraph
- ggraph
- ggalluvial

Main analytical steps included:

1. Data import and cleaning
2. Keyword normalization
3. Annual scientific production analysis
4. Keyword co-occurrence network
5. Strategic thematic mapping
6. Thematic evolution analysis
7. International collaboration network analysis

## Key Results

The bibliometric analysis highlights:

- Rapid growth of EBPR research after 2018
- Increasing focus on microbial ecology and resource recovery
- Emerging technologies such as aerobic granular sludge
- Strong international collaboration centered around China, USA, and Australia
